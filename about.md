# About Me
 
Hi! I'm Philippe, Statistician and physical therapist based in Belgium with a strong interest in science, movement, and technology. I have years of hands-on experience helping people improve their mobility, reduce pain, and live healthier lives through personalized treatments and evidence-based practice.

In addition to my clinical work, I'm passionate about data and technology. I actively work with statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and I'm always exploring ways to apply these tools in healthcare, research, and beyond.

This site is a space for me to share what I'm learning, document projects, and connect with others who are curious about the intersection of health, science, and tech. Whether you're here for code, insights, or simply to see what I'm working on â€” welcome!

## Interests
